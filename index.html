        <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>With 9 years’ experience in sales and over 10 years in the hospitality industry I am a hugely
                self-motivated, confident, and driven individual who strives on challenges and delivering
                great customer service and sales targets. I have a passion for training and developing my
                teams and customers and have been consistently commended on the quality of my
                leadership skills.</p>
                
                <p>The roles I have done have made me very organised and my time planning is very important
                to me. I am good at working both remotely alone but also collaborating and working within
                larger teams. I have a professional telephone manner and speedy response rate via email. I
                deal with rejection well and am not willing to take no for an answer!</p>
                
                <p>My sales style is conversational, and I am an advocate of fact finding and problem solving.
                Listening to prospective customers and then building proposals around their needs is a core
                part of my working day. I understand that building a clear, laser focused strategy is key to
                the success within such busy markets like the beverage industry. Going above and beyond
                for my customers is very important to me and I do as much work for them as I can. This
                could be anything from GP calculations of their menus, supporting to source the best
                ingredients for their serves to creating presentations they can use to present to their teams
                as trainings.</p>
                
                <p>I am commercially focused and always looking at creative ways to support my customers
                which make the most sense to their needs without diluting the broader message which the
                brand is wanting to present. I understand the difference between value and cost and how
                this can work to each party’s advantage to help maintain listings and relationships. With all
                my experience and also traveling through hospitality within the UK I also have a good
                understanding of different regions, trends and cultures all around the country. I have built
                strategies to penetrate these markets as a small team through events, tasting and building
                the correct advocacy.</p>
                
                <p>I am comfortable building creative sales & marketing campaigns from the ground up, alone
                but also within a team and often do this for customers as well as the brands I am working
                with.</p>

        <h2>Experience</h2>
            <h4>August 2021 - Present</h4>
            <h4>Sales Manager > Sales Director, bbb drinks, UK</h4>
                <p>I joined the team at bbb drinks at a moment when the team was expanding and some new
                and exciting brands where due to join the portfolio. When coming on board I had a few clear
                tasks to begin with. bbb were keen to bring the strategy building skills I had utilised while at
                Southwestern Distillery across, begin the recruitment process as some positions had become
                available and start to focus the portfolio on on-trade groups.</p>
                
                <p>I aligned quickly with the bbb ethos, culture, and the brands we were working with and was
                in a position to hit the ground running. Working closely with the Sales Director we built clear
                KPI’s for the team to enable us to track progress throughout the year and to ensure we were
                hitting number of new listings alongside the aggressive volume targets.
                I am also pleased to work closely with the Marketing Director and Marketing Manager to
                help build creative campa
                igns for each of our brands which are commercially sound and
                appropriate for our audience.</p>
                
                <p>As part of the bbb business is consultancy for new brands I have also put together tender
                drafts for new brands to market who have requested our help at the early stages of their
                development alongside building sales strategies for each new brand that comes into our
                portfolio.</p>
                
                In July 2023 I was promoted to Sales Director, taking more of a lead on choosing brands
                that came into our portfolio and also managing our brands by providing reports and
                updates on their progress in the market.</p>

            <h4>Head of On-Trade & Field Sales Manager, Tarquin's Gin (Southwestern Distillery), UK</h4>
                <p>I started with Tarquin’s Gin as London Account Manager but was quickly elevated to Field
                    Sales Manager and a focused sales role with Prestige Accounts. During this time I won many
                    key accounts including Harvey Nichols, Hedonism, Selfridges, American Bar at The Savoy,
                    The Gibson Bar, Nightjar, The Goring Hotel just to name a few. Along with these I
                    successfully secured a collaborative limited-edition gin with The Rosewood Hotel which is
                    now the house gin within the Holborn Dining Room. I am currently Head of On-Trade along
                    with looking after a Field Sales Team of 8 with a focus on national On-Trade Accounts and
                    Wholesalers.</p>
                    
                    <p>I am proud to be an integral part of helping Tarquin’s Cornish Gin becoming within the top
                    five independent distilleries in the UK and have listed a few further key personal wins
                    below:</p>

            <h4>September 2015 - August 2017</h4>
            <h4>Gin Champion & Mr Copperhead UK, 10 Degrees C, UK</h4>
                <p>During my time with 10 Degrees C I worked closely with the Copperhead Gin team to
                    successfully launch the brand in the UK alongside a number of other products including
                    Nordes Gin, East Imperial Tonic, De Borgen Genever and more. Within the first twelve
                    months I managed to secure the biggest international account for Copperhead Gin which
                    enabled us to be the exclusive spirit brand with an immersive theatre company which saw
                    sales of almost 3,000 bottles per year and helped develop the brand through consumer and
                    corporate events.</p>

            <h4>July 2014 - September 2015</h4>
            <h4>Head Bartender, Reunion Bar (Grosvenor Hotel), London</h4>
                <p>At Reunion Bar I was responsible for a team of between 5 and 7 at any one time. I ran the operations in
                    the bar under the Hotel’s Bar Manager along with developing innovative drinks menus and
                    helping to develop the food offering. Within my time here Reunion became the most
                    successful F&B outlet in the whole hotel, and we managed to gain over 60% growth with a
                    new menu. My focus was on ensuring customer service and high rates of sales through busy
                    periods and helped host events for the likes of Channel Four, American Express, Google and
                    Vodafone. I was also asked to feature on Gaby Roslin’s BBC Radio show to discuss our new
                    menu and the concept of the bar.</p>
            
            <h4>June 2011 - June 2014</h4>
            <h4>Head Barman, The Vineyard Hotel & Spa, Berkshire</h4>
                <p>Being in the position of Head Barman at an independently owned five-star property has
                    been an incredible experience. I was brought in to expand the offering of the bar and bring it
                    up to date. I am responsible for everything on the bar including the creation of our new
                    cocktails, list management, stock control, cashing up and running both lunch and dinner
                    shifts. During this time I planned events, tastings and promotions which proved to be some
                    of the most successful The Vineyard had ever seen</p>
            
            <h4>April 2010 - June 2011</h4>
            <h4>Bar & Lounge Supervisor, Cedar Court Grand Hotel, York</h4>
                <p>I was part of the opening team of Yorks first five-star hotel where I had the opportunity to build the
                    team from scratch through training and setting up procedures. I was in control of the rotas,
                    interviewing and recruitment, stock control and adapting the list. I set up the health and
                    safety procedures and training programs which help make the department one of the most
                    successful.</p>

            <h4>October 2004 - March 2010</h4>
            <h4>Management Training, Hotel du Vin Group, UK</h4>
                <p>Through this long period of training, I experienced every department of two different
                    properties: each time working my way from the bottom to the top. I was given the
                    opportunity to explore every area of the Hotels and progressed to Reception Supervisor in
                    York. In the end I returned to the bar which I had always found the most interesting as Head
                    Bartender working closely with the Bar Manager & Head Sommelier on all aspects of the
                    role.</p>
